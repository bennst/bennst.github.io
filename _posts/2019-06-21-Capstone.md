**General Assembly Data Science Final Project**  <br />  <br /> Instacart Sales Prediction (Market Basket Analysis) – Identifying consumer buying behavior and product recommendation. 

Instacart is an American technology company that operates as a same-day grocery delivery and pick-up service in the U.S. and Canada. MBA is used by retailers to boost business by predicting what items customers buy together. 



**Getting the Right Data**

I used the data sets provided for the Kaggle competition by Instacart <link>. It consisted of orders made by approximately 200K users for the year 2017. Data was provided in the form of CSV files along with the data dictionary.
The figures below portray the data details.  

I have uploaded the data into postgreSQL. The below figure shows the table structures of the data set. 

*Figure 1: A description of the dataset is shown below.*

**Data Analysis**

On analyzing the data, I inferred the following predominant consumer buying behavior patterns -

(a)	It was noticed that the purchases reached the peak during the first two days of the week.

(b)	Aisles selling fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, packaged fruits and vegetables, and yogurt had the highest sales.

(c)	Departments such as produce, dairy, eggs, beverages, snacks, frozen and pantry have the highest sales.

(d)	Product wise it was noticed that banana, bag of organic bananas and other  organic products such as strawberry and baby spinach have the highest sales.

(e)	I also observed that the frequency in which the purchases occurred reached its maximum (highest sales) during intervals of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days with the peak being reached on the 30th day of every month.

**K Mean Cluster**

I have tried to group the consumers based on the above mentioned parameters and found that they could be clustered into 3 groups as shown in the elbow diagram.

*Figure 4: Consumer grouping elbow diagram.*

** 20 Highest buying products of the  3 goups of consumers**

The highet moving products of the above groups is shown in the below figures. 

*Figure 5: 20 Highest buying products of the  3 goups of consumers.*

It appears that the top twenty products purchased are the same and begin to differ from the sixth product. 

**Apriori Alogorithm**

I made use of the Association Rule Mining technique via Apriori Algorithm in Python. This statistical technique is used to identify underlying relations between different items.  

There are three major components of Apriori algorithm (see diagram delow):
•	Support - refers to the default popularity of an item and can be calculated by finding number of transactions containing a particular item divided by total number of transactions.
•	Confidence - refers to the likelihood that an item B is also bought if item A is bought. It can be calculated by finding the number of transactions where A and B are bought together, divided by total number of transactions where A is bought.
•	Lift - Lift(A -> B) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of B when A is sold. Lift(A –> B) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(A -> B) divided by Support(B).

For instance, if item A and B are bought together more frequently then several steps can be taken to increase the profit. For example:
1.	A and B can be placed together so that when a customer buys one of the product he doesn't have to go far away to buy the other product. 
2.	People who buy one of the products can be targeted through an advertisement campaign to buy the other. 
3.	Collective discounts can be offered on these products if the customer buys both of them. 
4.	Both A and B can be packaged together.


**Highest selling groups of products **

The highest moving set of products are shown in the below figures.

**Products & product sets recommendation**

The products and product sets can be recommended to the consumers when they log in to the website.
Sample of products and product sets recommendations are shown below.

**Store plan recommendation**

Based on the findings from the modeling and exploration of data, the store plan has been recommended as shown below. 
The size of the box corresponds to the sales volume, the bigger the size of the box the higher the sales.
