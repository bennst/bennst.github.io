##### Benny Stephen, Data Scientist 
I'm a data scientist who graduated from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course in June 2019. A software engineer by profession, having dabbled with data as a senior database developer, I enjoy transforming raw data into insights and predicting trends to build creative solutions for businesses. 
I am passionate about learning new technologies and techniques and applying them in order to facilitate strategic business decisions.
